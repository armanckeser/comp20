# Assignment 3 on Flask, PyMongo(Flask)
Ahmet Armanc Keser

This is the implementation of assignment 3 on flask.
It was quite hard to get right, especially the deployment
to Heroku, I couldn't get it to work without hardcoding the
password. Learning Flask from ground up was fun, I don't yet
know the advantages of Flask over express, but I think it is
an important skill to learn.
